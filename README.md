This interactive Markdown document is designed to support the prioritization of climate adaptation investments at the regional level for CGIAR science programs. It accompanies a publication and provides an interactive interface for exploring the intersection of climate hazards and agricultural exposure. The primary goal is to aid decision-makers in identifying and prioritizing regions and crops most vulnerable to climate risks.

In addition to its specific application for CGIAR programs, this codebase is built to be fully repeatable and customizable, enabling adaptation for other purposes or regions. By incorporating flexible input datasets and scalable hazard combinations, the tool is suited to a wide range of agricultural and environmental risk assessments.
